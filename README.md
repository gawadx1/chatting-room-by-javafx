# Chat Room Application

This repository contains a **Chat Room Application** built using advanced Java technologies. The project is designed to demonstrate the integration of real-time communication, data management, and a user-friendly interface, all implemented using core and advanced Java concepts.

## Features

- **Intuitive User Interface**: Designed with **JavaFX** to provide a seamless user experience.
- **Real-Time Communication**: Implemented using **Socket Programming** to allow users to send and receive messages in real time.
- **Efficient Data Management**: Utilized **JDBC** and **SQL** for managing user data, message history, and other persistent data efficiently.
- **Multi-Threaded Interaction**: Supports concurrent interactions, enabling multiple users to communicate simultaneously without performance issues.

## Technologies Used

1. **JavaFX**: For building the graphical user interface.
2. **JDBC**: For database connectivity.
3. **SQL**: To manage and query data efficiently.
4. **Socket Programming**: For implementing the chat's real-time communication features.
5. **Multi-Threading**: To optimize the server and client interaction for concurrent users.

## Project Highlights

- **Performance Optimization**: The server is designed to handle multiple client connections simultaneously using multi-threading, ensuring smooth communication without delays.
- **Collaborative Development**: This project provided hands-on experience in collaborative software development, mimicking real-world professional workflows.
- **Skill Development**: Improved proficiency in advanced Java programming concepts and practical implementation.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the Repository**:
